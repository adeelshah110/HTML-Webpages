      Google defnes a keyword as an isolated word or phrase that provides
      concise high-level information about content to readers . With
      the increasing amount of data, users need more resources and time to
      understand content. Keywords make it easier to understand the
      meaning of a text in fewer words. 
      <p>  In short, keywords summarize the
        key points presented in the text. When searching for information on
        search engines, keywords play a signifcant role in fnding relevant
        content. Keywords are the mostinformative part of a text; they are
        the most prominent words in the text and describe its content.
        Keywords are necessary in situations involving huge amounts of text
        data that need to be processed automatically. Keywords are widely
        used in document summarization, indexing, categorization, and
        clustering of huge datasets. Many scientifc publications contain
        keyword lists that have been explicitly assigned by their authors.
        Other documents, however, have not been assigned keywords . As
        webpages are constantly updated, it is difcult to create keywords
        manually. Manual keyword assignment is labor intensive, time
        consuming, and error prone.</p>
     <p>Specialized curators use fxed taxonomies
      for manual keyword generation, but in some cases, the keywords
      chosen by the author are not sufciently comprehensive and accurate.
      Without high-quality keywords, users fail to catch relevant
      information  . Keywords ofer readers a concise high-level summary
      of a documents content, thereby improving their understanding of
      that text. Keywords are the most relevant and important indicator
      for users seeking to grasp the fundamentals of a topic when scanning
      or skimming an article. Keyword extraction is a basic step in many
      text-mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques,
      including text summarization, information retrieval, topic modeling,
      clustering, and content-based advertisement systems. Finding the
      relevant webpages, a user is seeking is often a challenging task for
      which representative keywords or keyphrases.</p>
